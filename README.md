# Tint-My-Image

*This application is a little demo application I made to learn Kotlin and scoped storage in Android 11.*

Tint My Image will allow you to pick any image from your phone, allow you to change the image transparency and add a tint on top of your image. So if you have an image that you want to match with your Cyan color theme, then just select that image in this application, adjust the transparency you would like and then add cyan tint to it. Once you're done, you can share the image or store it.


I'm planning to add different effect to the image in future and an ability to set the modified image as wallpaper.
